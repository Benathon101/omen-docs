    **Alternate Rules: Omens as HP** <br />
    In a variant of Omen known as _SUPER ULTRA OMEN_ which is a super hero setting, players get twice
    as many Omen tokens but those tokens also act as the players health. This creates a dynami knife's
    edge feeling as HP becomes like more of a stamina meter.
